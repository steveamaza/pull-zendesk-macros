We consider Bulk SMS an instant value business which comes with some certain requirements. The major requirement here is that customers trying to pay on your platform will not be able to pay more than N3,000 per time for a single transaction. The reason for this is that services like Bulk SMS are immediately delivered to the customer on payment which leaves you, the merchant, and Paystack open to chargebacks, should the transaction be determined fraudulent by the bank. <br><br>Following this, I would advise that you create a second account primarily for only your Bulk SMS business so that the N3,000 restriction would not affect your other customers trying to pay for your other services. To add a new business to your account, go to the top left corner of your Paystack Dashboard and click the drop-down arrow beside your business name. You will see an option to 'Add a business'.<br><br>Kindly let me know when you have done this edit to enable me to activate your business accordingly. Also, if you have any questions about this, I'd be happy to explain further.<br><br>Best regards,<br></p>"

While reviewing your business, we noticed that the kind of service you provide falls under the instant value category - what this means is that your customers get value for payment (almost) immediately after a successful payment is made. This basically makes it impossible to recover value from the customer should the payment be determined as suspicious by the bank.<br><br>The workaround this is that all instant value businesses on Paystack are placed on a limit of N3,000 per single transaction and N20,000 per total daily transaction from one customer. The implication is that a customer on your platform will be able to make a maximum of N3,000 per transaction and a total maximum of N20,000 per day. <br><br>We consider this reasonable as we expect this to be around the average price of your product and also, this decision serves to protect you and us from potential chargebacks from the bank.<br><br>In case you need further clarification or have follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to let me know :)<br></p>"

My name is YOUR NAME from the Reviews &amp; Business Compliance Unit at Paystack. </p><p><br></p><p>Every now and then, our risk assessment team conducts routine reviews of merchants and their businesses. After our review, we've realized that your business model is a Ponzi/Pyramidal Scheme, where your customers need to keep paying so that others will get paid. We would like to draw your attention to Sections 1 and 2 of Paystack’s Acceptable Use Policy (<a href=\"https://paystack.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://paystack.com/terms</a>), which states that Paystack may not be used in connection with any product, service, transaction or activity that support pyramid or Ponzi schemes, matrix programs, other \"get rich quick\" schemes or certain multi-level marketing programs.</p><p><br></p><p>Based on the this, we’ve decided to disable your Paystack account today and we'll be refunding all the pending settlements to the cardholders as we must ensure our merchants’ compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy to prevent Paystack’s liability exposure.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s frustrating for us to have to turn away businesses, but unfortunately, we have no flexibility here. Kindly accept our apologies, and we hope to work with you in the future should you present a business that falls within the terms of our Acceptable Use Policy. Let me know if you have any questions about this and I'll be happy to answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for your interest in Paystack!</p><p><br></p><p>Best regards,<br></p>"
